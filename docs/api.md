# Lantern local API and result files

For anyone building a front end for Lantern, including the UI handoff from the design package. **The backend
already exists** (`lantern serve`, `lantern/server.py`); a new UI is built against this API and reads these
files. Do not invent a schema from the spec's chapter 13: that chapter describes the future cloud service.

The UI lives in `lantern/viewer/`: `app.html` (the app shell: Home, Projects, Explanations, Learn, Settings),
`report.html` (the Atlas, Findings and Readiness, one self-contained file, also served inside the app), and the
Evidence Report rendered by `lantern/evidence.py`. A redesign replaces those files; the server stays as it is.

## Build sequence

1. **Home → Projects → Atlas** (`/api/state`, `POST /api/projects`, `/analyze`, jobs, `/p/<id>/report.html`).
2. **Findings → Finding → Fix** (`security.json` via the report bundle; Accept risk; Send to…).
3. **Readiness and Protections** (`readiness.json`), **Explanations** (`/plan`, `/explain`, `/explanation`).
4. **Evidence Report** and the badge (`/p/<id>/evidence.html`, `badge.svg`, `evidence.json`).
5. **Settings**: model and key, privacy, appearance, **Connections** (`/api/connections`, `/api/allowance`).
6. **Learn** (starters) last; it is self-contained.

## Rules the UI must keep

* Every value from a result file goes through an escaper before it reaches the page. Result files sit inside
  the analyzed folder, which may be a stranger's repository, so they can be planted. The server already
  rebuilds every page from our templates and sends a hash-based Content-Security-Policy; a new UI keeps both
  (`tools/poison_report.py` and the browser tests in CI prove it).
* Facts come from the files; words come from models. The UI never computes a finding, a rank or a path, and
  never offers a way to close a finding without a written reason.
* `report.html` must stay one self-contained file that works offline, from disk, and on a phone.
* No external requests from any page (no CDN fonts or scripts).
* Status colors (good / warning / serious / critical) mean risk or results only and always sit beside a word.

## Authentication

`lantern serve` prints `http://127.0.0.1:8765/?token=...`. The first visit sets a `lantern_token` cookie
(SameSite=Strict, HttpOnly). Every write (`POST`, `DELETE`) also needs the token in the `X-Lantern-Token`
header; the app gets it from `window.LANTERN_TOKEN` (injected into `app.html`) and the report from
`window.LANTERN_LIVE.token`. Wrong or missing token → 401. The `Host` header must name the server.

## Endpoints

All JSON. Errors are `{"error": "message"}` with 4xx/5xx. Long work returns a **job** (HTTP 202) to poll.

### State

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/state` | `{"version", "projects": [project summary…], "settings": {provider, model, base_url, privacy}, "providers": [provider row…]}` |
| `GET /api/jobs/<id>` | `{"id", "project", "kind": "analyze"\|"explain"\|"clone", "status": "running"\|"done"\|"error", "log": [lines], "result", "error", "started", "finished"}` |
| `GET /api/fs?path=` | Folder listing for the Browse dialog: `{"path", "parent", "dirs": [names]}` |

**Project summary** (one per project): `id`, `path`, `name`, `added`, `exists`, `has_report`, `score` (0–100 or null),
`grade` (A–F or null), `shape` (deployment shape string), `counts` `{critical, high, medium, low, accepted}` or null,
`finished_at`, `explained` (number of explained functions), `job` (running job id or null), `starter` (starter id
when the project came from Learn).

**Provider row**: `name`, `local` (true for Ollama/LM Studio, false for cloud, null for openai-compatible),
`needs_key`, `env` (environment variable name), `default_url`, `key` (where a key is set: "this session",
"remembered on this computer", "environment variable X", or null), `notice` (data-location text to show before
code is sent). The `deepseek` row adds `default: true` and `allowance: true` when the free allowance is usable.

### Projects

| Route | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/projects` | `{"path": "/folder or https://github.com/owner/repo"}` | A folder: the project summary (200). A link: `{"job", "project"}` (202) while it clones and analyzes |
| `DELETE /api/projects/<id>` | | `{"ok": true, "note"}`; files are never deleted |
| `POST /api/projects/<id>/analyze` | | job (202). Builds the map, scans, scores readiness, writes report and Evidence Report |
| `GET /api/projects/<id>/plan?depth=3&limit=40` | | `{"nodes": N, "input_tokens", "output_tokens", "note"}`: what an explain run would cover (an estimate, no model call) |
| `POST /api/projects/<id>/explain` | `{"nodes": [ids]}` for some, or `{"depth", "limit"}` for the plan | job (202). Log lines include `free explanations left: N` and `stopped early: …` when the allowance runs out |
| `GET /api/projects/<id>/explanation?node=<id>` | | `{"record": explanation record or null, "metaphor": {"world", "roles"}}` |
| `POST /api/projects/<id>/accept` | `{"finding": id, "reason": "≥10 letters, two words", "by": name}` or `{"finding", "remove": true}` | job (202): writes `lantern-accepted.json` in the repo and re-analyzes. A weak reason → 400 |
| `POST /api/projects/<id>/cmd` | `{"argv": ["analyze", "--offline"]}` | The terminal drawer. job (202) whose log the drawer prints. `argv` is a list of strings (never a shell line; at most 64 items). Allowed: `analyze [--offline] [--no-scan] [--privacy]`, `trace [--] TEST COMMAND` (through the test sandbox; typing it counts as the confirmation), `explain [--node ID…] [--depth N] [--max-nodes N]`, `report [--privacy]`, `verify [--report FILE]`, `accept ID --reason "…" [--by]` / `accept ID --remove` (same reason check as the UI), `packs`, `export [--sarif FILE]` (default `.lantern/findings.sarif`), `learn [--check]`; a leading `lantern` is dropped. `--out` is always the project's `.lantern/`; path arguments must resolve inside the project. Anything else → 400 `{"error", "allowed": [...], "help"}`. Token and Host checks as on every write |
| `GET /api/projects/<id>/testcmd` | | The command the "Watch my tests run" sheet shows first: `{"command", "how", "language": "python\|node\|go\|rust\|java", "supported", "traced", "note", "cwd"?, "sandbox": {"name": "docker\|subprocess", "label", "image", "details": [lines]}, "leaves", "confirmed"}`. `traced` is true for Python only ("Tests run; your map upgrades for Python only for now") |
| `POST /api/projects/<id>/trace` | `{"command": "python -m pytest -q", "confirm": true}` | job (202). Only test runners (`sandbox.check_command`; anything else → 400). The first run of a command for a project needs `confirm: true` (409 otherwise); later runs of the same command do not. Runs in `lantern/sandbox.py` and re-analyzes; the job result is `{"returncode", "observed", "recall", "backend", "language", "traced", "timed_out", "blocked": [{"kind": "write\|network", "what"}], "note", "score_before", "score_after", "summary"}` |
| `POST /api/projects/<id>/starter` | `{"name": "Dockerfile"}` | `{"ok", "wrote"}`; never overwrites |
| `GET /api/projects/<id>/learn` | | Starter progress: `{"steps": [{"title", "done", …}]}` |

### Pages and files per project

| Route | Content |
|---|---|
| `GET /p/<id>/report.html` | The Atlas page, rebuilt from the data with live actions enabled (`window.LANTERN_LIVE = {api, token, model, local, view_mode}`). `view_mode` (`simple`/`advanced`) is the saved setting and wins over the browser's `localStorage`; switching inside the Atlas saves it with `POST /api/settings` and calls the app's `window.lanternViewMode(settings)` so its toggle agrees |
| `GET /p/<id>/evidence.html` | The Evidence Report |
| `GET /p/<id>/evidence.json` | Its data (schema below) |
| `GET /p/<id>/badge.svg` | `Lantern · commit 1a2b3c · 0 critical · Oct 31` |

### Settings and connections

| Route | Body / returns |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/settings` | `{"provider", "model", "base_url", "privacy": "full"\|"structure", "view_mode"?: "simple"\|"advanced", "backdrop"?: "off"\|"subtle"\|"bold", "share_usage"?: bool, "key"?, "remember"?: bool, "forget_key"?: true}` (fields left out keep their saved values; an unknown `view_mode` is saved as `simple`) → `{"settings", "providers"}` |
| `GET /api/allowance` | `{"available": bool, "used_requests", "limit_requests", "remaining_requests", "remaining_today", "used_tokens", "limit_tokens"}` |
| `GET /api/packs?project=<id>` | `{"packs": [{"name", "version", "source": "builtin"\|"project"\|"user", "rules": n, "entry_patterns": n, "path", "enabled": bool, "active": bool\|null, "about"}]}`. Built-in and user packs always; the project's own `lantern-packs/*.json` when `project` is given. `active`: its `requires` match that project (null without a project). Python web and TypeScript web are the engine, not packs, and are not listed |
| `POST /api/packs` | `{"name", "enabled": bool, "project"?: id}` → `{"ok", "packs"}`. Writes `settings.json → "packs": {"disabled": [names], "changed_at"}` for every project; an unknown name or a non-boolean `enabled` → 400. Nothing is re-analyzed: projects whose report is older than the change get `"stale": "packs"` in `/api/state` and the card shows "Re-check to apply". The next analysis skips disabled packs, lists them in `graph.json` `meta.packs.disabled`, and the Evidence Report's provenance names each pack with its status (`ok (…)` or `off (turned off in Settings)`) |
| `GET /api/connections` | `{"connections": [{"name", "version", "last_used" (unix s), "calls", "last_tool"}], "now", "setup": {"claude_code": "claude mcp add lantern -- … mcp", "json": {mcpServers…}}}` |
| `POST /api/ask` | `{"project"?: id, "question", "focus"?: {"node"}}` → `{"answer", "cited": [finding ids]}` (or `{"answer", "no_model": true}`) |
| `POST /api/ask/screenshot` | multipart form, one file: PNG, JPEG or WebP up to 8 MB (larger, or another type → 400). Read on this computer: `{"width", "height", "format", "lines", "text"}`; without the Tesseract program `{"width", "height", "format", "text": null, "reason": "tesseract not installed", "how": "<one-line install for this OS>"}`. The image goes to Tesseract through a pipe, is never written to disk or sent anywhere, and is not kept after the response; the app quotes the text into the next question and then drops it |
| `GET /api/starters`, `/api/starters/<id>`, `/api/starters/<id>/fix?file=` | Learn catalog, one starter, the fixed version of a file |
| `POST /api/starters` | `{"id", "parent"}` → `{"project", "job"}` (201): scaffolds a starter app and analyzes it |

## Result files (`<project>/.lantern/`)

The Atlas page gets all of these in one bundle (`DATA` in `report.html`: `graph`, `security`, `readiness`,
`explanations`, `sources`, `stats`). The CLI writes the same files, so a UI can also be built on them directly.

### `graph.json`

`{"schema", "repo_root", "meta", "nodes": [...], "edges": [...], "unresolved": {text: count}}`

* Node: `id`, `kind` (`module`|`class`|`callable`|`external`), `name`, `qualname`, `file`, `start_line`, `end_line`,
  `parent`, `signature`, `docstring`, `decorators`, `entry` (null or `{"kind": "page"|"route"|"main"|"cli"|"script"|"test",
  "detail": "/admin" or "POST /backup", "via"?: "pack:django", "registered_at"?}`), `lane` (the stack strip stop the
  node lives on: `browser`|`frontend`|`server`|`data`, or null for an external that is not a data hop — see
  **Stack lanes** below).
* Edge: `src`, `dst`, `kind` (`calls`|`may_call`|`contains`|`implements`), `confidence`
  (`observed` > `resolved` > `inferred` > `possible`; the UI words are seen running / certain / likely / possible),
  `lines`, `via` (how it was resolved; `http-*` for a frontend→backend hop), `detail` (`PUT /api/items/{id}` on an
  HTTP edge, `onClick` on a UI edge).
* Node ids: Python `py:pkg.mod.Class.method`; JS `js:<path-without-ext>::<Local.name>`; external `ext:<pkg.member>`
  or `ext:HTTP <METHOD> <path>`.
* `meta`: `files`, `lines`, `languages`, `bridge` (link counts), `http_calls`, `packs` (`{added, ambiguous, unresolved, packs}`),
  `lanes` (`{browser, frontend, server, data}` node counts).

#### Stack lanes (the stack strip)

Four fixed stops, always in this order: **Browser → Frontend → Server → Data**. The UI draws them as the strip at the
top of every finding, function and path ("You are here: Server"), as swimlanes in the Path view (Simple default), and
as a four-dot glyph on list rows. `lantern/lanes.py` assigns them from the node id, file path and entry kind only — no
model, no extra analysis — so the UI never guesses:

| Lane | Rule | Hover definition |
|---|---|---|
| `browser` | a `page` entry point, or an `app start` main (the client bundle's root) | What the visitor sees and clicks. |
| `frontend` | any other JS/TS node in a client-side module | Your pages and screens: the code that builds what the browser shows. |
| `server` | every Python/Go/Rust/Java node; a JS/TS module that holds a route handler or a server start, or lives under `app/**/route.*`, `pages/api/`, `api/`, `server/`, `backend/`, `functions/`, `netlify/`, `supabase/functions/`, `workers/`, `middleware.*`; an `ext:HTTP` call whose target starts with `/` (the app's own API) | Code that runs on a machine you pay for, not the visitor's. |
| `data` | an external node that reaches a database, a file, the shell or an outside service (`sqlite3`, `psycopg`, `prisma`, `supabase`, `fs`, `subprocess`, `child_process`, `fetch`/`axios`/`requests` to another host, `stripe`, `openai`, `boto3`, …; the full list is `lanes.DATA_RE`); an `ext:HTTP` call to a host | Where things are kept or sent: the database, files, shell commands, outside services. |
| null | any other external (`json.dumps`, `hashlib.md5`) — not part of the stack picture | — |

The UI must keep the four stops in that order and use the same four words everywhere; a lane with no nodes in the
project is still drawn, dimmed.

### `security.json`

`{"findings": [...], "tools": [{"tool", "status", "version"}], "counts": {critical, high, medium, low, in_tests, accepted},
"id_version", "reachable_nodes", "total_callables"}`

Finding: `id` (stable across moves: tool, rule, file and the flagged line's text), `tool` (`bandit`, `pip-audit`,
`npm-audit`, `secrets`, `lantern-web`, `lantern-pack:<name>`), `rule`, `title`, `tool_severity`, `tool_confidence`
(`LOW` = show "heuristic"), `file`, `line`, `cwe`, `more_info`, `snippet`, `category`, `in_tests`, `node`,
`reachable` (null or `{"entry", "kind", "path": [node ids]}`), `reachable_from_tests_only`, `ui_path` (node ids from a
page, or null), `input` (null, `false`, or `{"via": "parameter `name`"}`), `rank` (`critical`|`high`|`medium`|`low`),
`status` (`open`|`accepted`), `accepted` (`{"reason", "by", "date"}` when accepted), `hot_lane` (the lane the problem
lives on: the pinned node's `lane`, or from the file for a finding with no node, e.g. a secret in `settings.py` →
`server`), `lanes` (every lane the finding's path crosses, in strip order, de-duplicated: the `ui_path` (or `reachable`
path) nodes' lanes, plus `hot_lane`, plus `data` when the pinned node calls a data-lane external — the glyph fills these
dots and colours the `hot_lane` dot by rank).

### `readiness.json`

`version`, `score`, `grade`, `shape`, `stack` (`{frameworks, …}`), `categories` (`[{key, title, weight, score, percent,
checks: [{id, title, points, earned, status: pass|fail|partial|skip, evidence, fix, how}]}]`), `next_steps` (the
highest-gain failed checks, with `gain` and `category`), `protections` (`[{id, title, status: add|check|in place, why,
evidence, found, how}]`), `advice` (deployment advice strings for the shape), `hotspots`, `env_vars`,
`starter` (`{filename: {content, snippet?}}`).

### `explanations.json`

`{"metaphor": {"world", "why", "roles"}, "explanations": {node id: record}, "stats": {...}}`

Record: `lens1` `{summary, inputs, outputs, side_effects, errors, role}`, `lens2` `{text, example, analogy}`,
`lens3` `{text, pairs: [{plain, technical, anchor: {type: symbol|lines|term, …}}]}`, `findings`
`[{id, lens1, lens2, fix}]`, `model`, `prompt_version`, `validated`, `validation_errors`, `attempts`, or
`{"error", "validated": false}` when the model failed. Show Lens 3 pairs as hover/tap links from the plain
phrase to the anchored code.

### `evidence.json`

`header` (`repo`, `name`, `commit`, `branch`, `dirty`, `remote`, `committed_at`, `generated_at`, `mode`, `privacy`),
`scorecard` (`readiness`, `now` counts, `before` counts, `baseline_date`, `baseline_commit`), `architecture`,
`security` (`open`, `accepted`, `fixed`, `changed`, `in_tests`, `protections`), `understanding`, `provenance`
(`tools`, `models`, `rules`, including analysis packs), `limits` (strings: what the report does not prove),
`digest` (`sha256:…`), `payload`.

### Other files

`run.json` (timings, privacy, offline, trace, finished_at), `baseline.json` (first-run findings for "fixed since"),
`cache/` (explanation cache). In the repo itself: `lantern-accepted.json` (accepted risks with reasons, committed),
`lantern-packs/*.json` (project analysis packs), `lantern-narratives.md` (the builder's own notes for the Evidence Report).

## Acceptance checklist per screen

* **Projects**: add by folder and by GitHub link; job log streams while analyzing; score, grade and counts update
  without reload; remove never deletes files.
* **Atlas**: pick a page or route, follow the path through click and HTTP hops to the backend; every edge shows its
  confidence word; unresolved count visible; works in the app iframe and opened from disk; phone layout.
* **Stack strip** (every screen that shows a finding, function or path): the four stops in order, "You are here"
  lit, the stops the path crosses filled, hover definitions in plain words; Path view has a Lanes mode (Simple default)
  where each node sits in its lane and the bad hop is red; list rows carry the four-dot glyph and "On the Server" in words,
  with the legend once above the list.
* **Findings / Finding**: ranked list with filters; click path from the page; "uses outside input"; heuristic tag;
  Open function; Accept risk asks for a reason and shows it afterwards; **Send to…** with Claude, ChatGPT, Copy.
* **Readiness / Protections**: score ring, categories, "do first" list, protections with add / check / in place,
  starter files written with one click and never overwriting.
* **Explanations**: plan (count and cost) before running; consent text with the provider's data notice; three
  lenses with anchored pairs; validation failures shown as such; allowance remaining and the clean stop.
* **Evidence**: before/after counts, fixed findings, provenance, Limits, digest and the verify command; badge
  wording exactly `Lantern · commit · N critical · date`.
* **Settings**: provider list with local/cloud marking and data notices; key remembered or session-only; privacy;
  theme; **Connections** rows by assistant name with last use, setup snippets, no connect/disconnect control.
* **Everything**: no JS errors in Chromium at desktop and phone widths (`tools/viewer_smoke.js`); the poisoned
  report (`tools/poison_report.py`) renders as text; `python -m pytest -q` and `bash tools/audit.sh --browser` green.
