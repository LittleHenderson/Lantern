# Changelog

Each release has a section headed `## <version>`. The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) puts the
section matching the pushed tag into the GitHub Release body (`v0.9.0-rc1` uses `## 0.9.0-rc1` if present, else `## 0.9.0`).

## Unreleased

- Scenarios: every finding now comes with a short story of one tester meeting it ("Priya opens the /admin page, clicks
  the backup button, types `report; whoami`…"), then what goes wrong and what the fix changes. Lantern builds it from
  its own facts (the page, the clicks, the route, whether typed input reaches the line), so it is there with no model.
  Explanations gain a fourth part, Scenario, next to Technical, Everyday and Mapped; a model's story that names code or
  a page the map does not show is removed, never shown. Prompt version `lens-v4`: explanations made before this are
  asked again on the next `lantern explain`.

## 0.9.0

First build for outside testers.

- One-command install: `pip install "git+https://github.com/LittleHenderson/Lantern@v0.9.0"`. Works with no extras;
  `lantern analyze` runs Lantern's own rules and says which optional scanners (Bandit, pip-audit) are off.
  `pip install "lantern[scan] @ git+https://github.com/LittleHenderson/Lantern@v0.9.0"` adds them.
- `lantern serve --check`: starts the app, prints the one-time link, loads the app once and stops (exit 0 if it answered).
- Release workflow: a pushed `v*` tag builds the sdist and wheel, runs the tests against the built wheel in a clean
  environment, and attaches both files to a GitHub Release.
- Clean-install test in CI on Linux, macOS and Windows.
